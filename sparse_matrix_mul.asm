# MIPS Assembly program for sparse matrix multiplication with UART communication
# This program receives matrix data via UART and performs sparse matrix multiplication
# 
# UART Reception:
# - Receives data in 4-byte groups (332 bytes total = 83 groups)
# - Converts from little-endian to big-endian format
# - Little-endian: LSB first (0x12345678 -> [0x78, 0x56, 0x34, 0x12])
# - Big-endian: MSB first (0x12345678 -> [0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78])
